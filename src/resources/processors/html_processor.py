This Splunk Quick Reference Guide describes key concepts and features, SPL (Splunk Processing Language) basics, as well as commonly used commands and functions for Splunk Cloud and Splunk Enterprise.

## Concepts

### Events

An **event** is a set of values associated with a timestamp. It is a single entry of data and can have one or multiple lines. An event can be a text document, a configuration file, an entire stack trace, and so on. This is an example of an event in a web activity log:

```
173.26.34.223 - - [01/ Mar/2021:12:05:27 -0700] "GET /trade/ app?action=logout HTTP/1.1" 200 2953
```

You can also define transactions to search for and group together events that are conceptually related but span a duration of time. Transactions can represent a multistep business-related activity, such as all events related to a single customer session on a retail website.

### Metrics

A metric data point consists of a timestamp and one or more measurements. It can also contain dimensions. A measurement is a metric name and corresponding numeric value. Dimensions provide additional information about the measurements. Sample metric data point:

```
Timestamp: 08-05-2020 16:26:42.025-0700
Measurement: metric_name:os.cpu. user=42.12, metric_name:max.size. kb=345
Dimensions: hq=us-west-1, group=queue, name=azd
```

Metric data points and events can be searched and correlated together, but are stored in separate types of indexes.

### Host, Source, and Source Type

A **host** is the name of the physical or virtual device where an event originates. It can be used to find all data originating from a specific device. A **source** is the name of the file, directory, data stream, or other input from which a particular event originates. Sources are classified into **source types**, which can be either well known formats or formats defined by the user. Some common source types are HTTP web server logs and Windows event logs.

Events with the same source types can come from different sources. For example, events from the file:

```
source=/var/log/messages
```

and from a syslog input port:

```
source=UDP:514
```

often share the source type:

```
sourcetype=linux_syslog
```

### Fields

**Fields** are searchable name and value pairings that distinguish one event from another. Not all events have the same fields and field values. Using fields, you can write tailored searches to retrieve the specific events that you want. When Splunk software processes events at index-time and search-time, the software extracts fields based on configuration file definitions and user-defined patterns.

Use the Field Extractor tool to automatically generate and validate field extractions at search-time using regular expressions or delimiters such as spaces, commas, or other characters.

### Tags

A **tag** is a knowledge object that enables you to search for events that contain particular field values. You can assign one or more tags to any field/value combination, including event types, hosts, sources, and source types. Use tags to group related field values together, or to track abstract field values such as IP addresses or ID numbers by giving them more descriptive names.

### Index-Time and Search-Time

During **index-time** processing, data is read from a source on a host and is classified into a source type. Timestamps are extracted, and the data is parsed into individual events. Line-breaking rules are applied to segment the events to display in the search results. Each event is written to an index on disk, where the event is later retrieved with a search request.

When a **search** starts, referred to as **search-time**, indexed events are retrieved from disk. **Fields** are extracted from the raw text for the event.

### Indexes

When data is added, Splunk software parses the data into individual events, extracts the timestamp, applies line-breaking rules, and stores the events in an **index**. You can create new indexes for different inputs. By default, data is stored in the "main" index. Events are retrieved from one or more indexes during a search.

## Core Features

### Search

Search is the primary way users navigate data in Splunk software. You can write a search to retrieve events from an index, use statistical commands to calculate metrics and generate reports, search for specific conditions within a rolling time window, identify patterns in your data, predict future trends, and so on. You transform the events using the Splunk Search Process Language (SPLâ„¢). Searches can be saved as reports and used to power dashboards.

### Reports

**Reports** are saved searches. You can run reports on an ad hoc basis, schedule reports to run on a regular interval, or set a scheduled report to generate alerts when the results meet particular conditions. Reports can be added to dashboards as dashboard panels.

### Dashboards

**Dashboards** are made up of panels that contain modules such as search boxes, fields, and data visualizations. Dashboard panels are usually connected to saved searches. They can display the results of completed searches, as well as data from real-time searches.

### Alerts

**Alerts** are triggered when search results meet specific conditions. You can use alerts on historical and real-time searches. Alerts can be configured to trigger actions such as sending alert information to designated email addresses or posting alert information to a web resource.

## Additional Features

### Datasets

Splunk allows you to create and manage different kinds of **datasets**, including lookups, data models, and table datasets. Table datasets are focused, curated collections of event data that you design for a specific business purpose. You can define and maintain powerful table datasets with Table Views, a tool that translates sophisticated search commands into simple UI editor interactions.

### Data Model

A **data model** is a hierarchically-organized collection of datasets. You can reference entire data models or specific datasets within data models in searches. In addition, you can apply data model acceleration to data models. Accelerated data models offer dramatic gains in search performance, which is why they are often used to power dashboard panels and essential on-demand reports.

### Apps

**Apps** are a collection of configurations, knowledge objects, and customer designed views and dashboards. Apps extend the Splunk environment to fit the specific needs of organizational teams such as Unix or Windows system administrators, network security specialists, website managers, business analysts, and so on. A single Splunk Enterprise or Splunk Cloud installation can run multiple apps simultaneously.

### Distributed Search

A **distributed search** provides a way to scale your deployment by separating the search management and presentation layer from the indexing and search retrieval layer. You use distributed search to facilitate horizontal scaling for enhanced performance, to control access to indexed data, and to manage geographically dispersed data.

## System Components

### Forwarders

A Splunk instance that forwards data to another Splunk instance is referred to as a **forwarder**.

### Indexer

An **indexer** is the Splunk instance that indexes data. The indexer transforms the raw data into events and stores the events into an index. The indexer also searches the indexed data in response to search requests. The search peers are indexers that fulfill search requests from the search head.

### Search Head

In a distributed search environment, the **search head** is the Splunk instance that directs search requests to a set of search peers and merges the results back to the user. If the instance does only search and not indexing, it is usually referred to as a dedicated search head.

## Search Processing Language (SPL)

A Splunk search is a series of commands and arguments. Commands are chained together with a pipe "|" character to indicate that the output of one command feeds into the next command on the right.

```
search | command1 arguments1 | command2 arguments2 | ...
```

At the start of the search pipeline, is an implied search command to retrieve events from the index. Search requests are written with keywords, quoted phrases, Boolean expressions, wildcards, field name/value pairs, and comparison expressions. The AND operator is implied between search terms. For example:

```
sourcetype=access_combined error | top 5 uri
```

This search retrieves indexed web activity events that contain the term "error". For those events, it returns the top 5 most common URI values.

Search commands are used to filter unwanted events, extract more information, calculate values, transform, and statistically analyze the indexed data. Think of the search results retrieved from the index as a dynamically created table. Each indexed event is a row. The field values are columns. Each search command redefines the shape of that table.

### Time Modifiers

You can specify a time range to retrieve events inline with your search by using the latest and earliest search modifiers. The relative times are specified with a string of characters to indicate the amount of time (integer and unit) and an optional "snap to" time unit. The syntax is:

```
[+|-]<integer><unit>@<snap_time_unit>
```

The search:

```
"error earliest=-1d@d latest=h@h"
```

retrieves events containing "error" that occurred yesterday snapping to the beginning of the day (00:00:00) and through to the most recent hour of today, snapping on the hour.

The snap to time unit rounds the time down. For example, if it is 11:59:00 and you snap to hours (@h), the time used is 11:00:00 not 12:00:00. You can also snap to specific days of the week using @w0 for Sunday, @w1 for Monday, and so on.

### Subsearches

A subsearch runs its own search and returns the results to the parent command as the argument value. The subsearch is run first and is contained in square brackets. For example, the following search uses a subsearch to find all syslog events from the user that had the last login error:

```
sourcetype=syslog [ search login error | return 1 user ]
```

### Optimizing Searches

The key to fast searching is to limit the data that needs to be pulled off disk to an absolute minimum. Then filter that data as early as possible in the search so that processing is done on the minimum data necessary.

- Partition data into separate indexes, if you will rarely perform searches across multiple types of data. For example, put web data in one index, and firewall data in another.
- Limit the time range to only what is needed. For example -1h not -1w, or earliest=-1d.
- Search as specifically as you can. For example, fatal_error not *error*
- Use post-processing searches in dashboards.
- Use summary indexing, and report and data model acceleration features.

### Machine Learning Capabilities

Splunk's Machine Learning capabilities are integrated across our portfolio and embedded in our solutions through offerings such as the Splunk Machine Learning Toolkit, Streaming ML framework and the Splunk Machine Learning Environment.

### SPL2

Several Splunk products use a new version of SPL, called SPL2, which makes the search language easier to use, removes infrequently used commands, and improves the consistency of the command syntax.

| **%p** | AM or PM | PM |
| **%Z** | Time zone (EST) | EST |
| **%z** | Time zone offset from UTC, in hour and minute: +hhmm or -hhmm. (-0500 for EST) | -0500 |
| **%s** | Seconds since 1/1/1970 (1308677092) | 1308677092 |

### Days
