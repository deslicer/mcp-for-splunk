    problem_description="My dashboard shows no data for the last 2 hours",
    earliest_time="-24h",
    latest_time="now",
    workflow_type="auto"
)

# Check tracing information in results
tracing_info = result.get('tracing_info', {})
print(f"Trace available: {tracing_info.get('trace_available')}")
