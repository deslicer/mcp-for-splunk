# Lab Execution Log – setup-your-personal-ai-sidekick.md

This log tracks execution of three labs:

- LINUX Guide: https://github.com/deslicer/dev1666/blob/main/docs/mcp/LINUX_GUIDE.md
- Set up your MCP server for Splunk: https://github.com/deslicer/dev1666/blob/main/set-up-your-mcp-server-for-splunk.md
- Create your custom MCP tool: https://github.com/deslicer/dev1666/blob/main/create-your-custom-mcp-tool.md

- Next Action: Continue with validation using local HTTP server

### Step 3: Validate server is reachable
- Status: ✅ Success
- Notes: Health at `http://127.0.0.1:8001/mcp/health` returned healthy and reported tools/resources/prompts.
- Next Action: Proceed to custom tool creation

## create-your-custom-mcp-tool.md

### Step 1: Scaffold a new tool
- Status: ✅ Success
- Notes: Generated `contrib/tools/examples/lab_guide_test.py` via generator.
- Next Action: Register/validate tool

### Step 2: Register tool and update config
- Status: ✅ Success
- Notes: Tool auto-discovered by modular loader; server health shows counts; validation ran.
- Next Action: Test the new tool

### Step 3: Test the new tool
- Status: ⚠️ Issue
- Notes: Validator reports missing test file for new tool; not created per generator choice. No runtime issues.
- Next Action: Optionally add `tests/contrib/examples/test_lab_guide_test.py` and run tests
