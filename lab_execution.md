## Lab 1: Set up MCP for Splunk (üîß)
Reference: `https://github.com/deslicer/dev1666/blob/main/set-up-your-mcp-server-for-splunk.md`

### Step 1: Install prerequisites
- Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue
- Notes: `uv` was not installed initially. Docker was not available. Installed `uv` via the official script and added it to PATH for this session. Skipped Docker path due to absence.
- Commands:
  - `uv --version` ‚Üí not found
  - Installed: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
  - Loaded PATH: `source $HOME/.local/bin/env`
  - Verified: `uv --version` ‚Üí `uv 0.8.13`
- Next Action: continue

### Step 2: Clone repo and checkout branch `dev1666`
- Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue
- Notes: Current workspace already contains the repo. Attempt to fetch `dev1666` branch failed (remote ref not found). Proceeded on current branch.
- Commands:
  - `git fetch origin dev1666` ‚Üí fatal: couldn't find remote ref dev1666
  - `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` ‚Üí used current branch
- Assumption: Proceed on the existing branch is acceptable for the lab.
- Next Action: continue

### Step 3: Sync project dependencies
- Status: ‚úÖ Success
- Notes: Dependencies installed using `uv sync`; virtual environment created at `.venv`.
- Commands:
  - `uv sync`
- Next Action: continue

### Step 4: Run the MCP server (Local Service)
- Status: ‚úÖ Success
- Notes: Started server directly to avoid interactive prompts: `uv run fastmcp run src/server.py --transport http --port 8003`. Verified HTTP 200 at `http://localhost:8003`.
- Commands:
  - `nohup uv run fastmcp run src/server.py --transport http --port 8003 > /workspace/logs.mcp_server.out 2>&1 &`
  - `curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' http://localhost:8003` ‚Üí 200
- Next Action: continue

### Step 5: Verify the MCP server (Automated test script)
- Status: ‚úÖ Success
- Notes: Ran `uv run python scripts/test_setup.py http://localhost:8003/mcp/`. Output shows connection success, tools/resources listed, `get_splunk_health` executed with status connected, and final success line.
- Commands:
  - `uv run python scripts/test_setup.py http://localhost:8003/mcp/`
- Expected/Observed Output (excerpt):
  - `‚úì Connected to MCP Server`
  - `... and 34 more tools`
  - `üìñ Reading Server Info: {"status":"running"}`
  - `‚úì Called 'get_splunk_health' successfully`
  - `‚úÖ MCP Server is running and responding correctly!`
- Next Action: Lab 1 complete

### Second Run (Lab 1)
- Status: ‚úÖ Success
- Notes: Stopped any existing server, re-synced dependencies, restarted on port 8003, and re-verified with the script. Received HTTP 200 and full success output including `status:"running"` and `get_splunk_health` connected.
- Next Action: Proceed to Lab 2 rerun

### Third Run (Lab 1) ‚Äî after git fetch and checkout `dev1666`
- Status: ‚úÖ Success
- Notes: Fetched latest branches/tags, checked out `dev1666`, restarted the server, and verified. Output shows successful connection, tools/resources listed (`... and 35 more tools`), `status:"running"`, and health connected.
- Next Action: Proceed to Lab 2 third run

## Lab 2: Create your custom MCP tool (üß©)
Reference: `https://github.com/deslicer/dev1666/blob/main/create-your-custom-mcp-tool.md`

### Step 1: Generate a tool with the helper script
- Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial
- Notes: Used non-interactive input via stdin to select `basic` template, `examples` category, tool name `hello_world`, and description. Tool file created at `contrib/tools/examples/hello_world.py`. Test file creation prompt ended with EOF (stdin piping ended), so tests were not created.
- Commands:
  - `printf '1\n1\nhello_world\nA simple example tool that returns a greeting\n2\n\n1\n' | uv run python ./contrib/scripts/generate_tool.py`
- Next Action: proceed to validation

### Step 2: Understand the tool structure
- Status: ‚úÖ Success
- Notes: Verified the generated `HelloWorldTool` inherits `BaseTool`, has `METADATA`, and async `execute` method.
- Next Action: continue

### Step 3: Validate the tool
- Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings
- Notes: Validator ran on `contrib/tools/examples/hello_world.py`. Reported warnings: many TODO comments and missing test file. No errors.
- Commands:
  - `uv run python ./contrib/scripts/validate_tools.py contrib/tools/examples/hello_world.py`
- Observed Output (excerpt):
  - `‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNINGS: Many TODO comments ...` and `No test file found ...`
- Next Action: continue

### Step 4: Run the tool in MCP Inspector
- Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Skipped
- Notes: The lab suggests opening MCP Inspector at `http://localhost:6274`. Node.js/Inspector not set up in this environment; server is running and accessible. This step is noted as optional in Lab 1 and recommended here.
- Assumption: Skipping UI verification is acceptable; server verifies via script.
- Next Action: continue

### Step 5: Troubleshooting your tool
- Status: ‚úÖ N/A
- Notes: Not required‚Äîtool validated with warnings only; server functional.
- Next Action: Lab 2 complete

### Second Run (Lab 2)
- Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial
- Notes: Generated a new tool `hello_world_v2` via stdin piping; tool file created at `contrib/tools/examples/hello_world_v2.py`. Validation produced warnings (TODOs and missing tests); no errors. Inspector step skipped (same reason as above).
- Commands:
  - `printf '1\n1\nhello_world_v2\nSecond run example tool\n2\n\n1\n' | uv run python ./contrib/scripts/generate_tool.py`
  - `uv run python ./contrib/scripts/validate_tools.py contrib/tools/examples/hello_world_v2.py`
- Next Action: Complete

### Third Run (Lab 2)
- Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial
- Notes: Generated `hello_world_v3` via stdin piping; tool file created at `contrib/tools/examples/hello_world_v3.py`. Validator warned about TODOs and missing tests; no errors. Inspector step skipped.
- Commands:
  - `printf '1\n1\nhello_world_v3\nThird run example tool\n2\n\n1\n' | uv run python ./contrib/scripts/generate_tool.py`
  - `uv run python ./contrib/scripts/validate_tools.py contrib/tools/examples/hello_world_v3.py`
- Next Action: Complete

## Overall Notes
- Splunk credentials: Not provided in this environment; server health indicated a configured connection via server-side defaults.
- Docker path: Not executed due to missing Docker.
- Interactive prompts: Avoided by running server directly and piping inputs to the generator.
