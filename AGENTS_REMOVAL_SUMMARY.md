## 🔒 Security Measures Taken

### 1. **Backup Created**
- ✅ Created `src/tools/agents_backup/` before removal
- ✅ Full backup of entire agents directory structure
- ✅ Can be restored if needed: `cp -r src/tools/agents_backup src/tools/agents`

### 2. **Functionality Verification**
- ✅ Verified all workflow tools working before removal
- ✅ Verified all shared utilities working before removal
- ✅ Verified tools module integration working before removal
- ✅ Tested after removal to confirm no functionality lost

### 3. **Reference Cleanup**
- ✅ Removed agent tool references from `src/core/loader.py`
- ✅ Updated `src/tools/__init__.py` to import workflows instead of agents
- ✅ Confirmed no remaining references to agents directory

## 🧪 Testing Results

### ✅ All Tests Passed:
- [x] Workflow tools working: `WorkflowRunnerTool`, `ListWorkflowsTool`, `WorkflowBuilderTool`, `WorkflowRequirementsTool`
- [x] Shared utilities working: `AgentConfig`, `SplunkDiagnosticContext`, `SplunkToolRegistry`, `TaskDefinition`
- [x] Tools module integration working
- [x] No breaking changes detected
- [x] All functionality preserved

## 📊 Impact Analysis

### Files Removed:
- **Total Files**: 12 files
- **Total Size**: ~400KB of code
- **Lines of Code**: ~8,000+ lines

### Functionality Preserved:
