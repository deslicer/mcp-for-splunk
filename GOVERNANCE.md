# Project Governance

## Maintainers

Deslicer, Inc. maintains this project. Maintainers review and merge PRs, cut releases, and guide the roadmap.

## Decision Making

- Day-to-day decisions: made in issues/PRs by maintainers based on community feedback.
- Larger changes (APIs, licensing, roadmap): proposed via an RFC issue and approved by at least two maintainers.

## Becoming a Maintainer

Contributors demonstrating sustained, high-quality contributions may be invited to become maintainers.
