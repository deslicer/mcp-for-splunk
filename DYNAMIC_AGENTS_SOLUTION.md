# Dynamic Micro-Agents Solution

## Problem Statement

Your original approach was hitting OpenAI rate limits because it passed all troubleshooting instructions to every LLM call. While the previous parallel micro-agents solution helped, you identified a key inefficiency: **creating specific agent files for each task type was not scalable or flexible**.

You asked: *"Would it not be more efficient if we had one micro-agent that is dynamic based on the inputs it gets, rather than creating all these specific agents?"*

**Answer: Absolutely! This dynamic approach is much more efficient and flexible.**

## Solution: Dynamic Micro-Agents Architecture

### Core Innovation: One Dynamic Agent Template

Instead of creating specific agent files (`license_agent.py`, `index_agent.py`, `permissions_agent.py`, etc.), we now use **ONE dynamic agent template** that can be configured for any task.

```python
# OLD APPROACH: Multiple specific agent files
src/tools/agents/micro/license_agent.py      # ❌ Static, inflexible
src/tools/agents/micro/index_agent.py        # ❌ Static, inflexible  
src/tools/agents/micro/permissions_agent.py  # ❌ Static, inflexible
src/tools/agents/micro/time_range_agent.py   # ❌ Static, inflexible

# NEW APPROACH: One dynamic template
src/tools/agents/shared/dynamic_agent.py     # ✅ Dynamic, flexible
```

### Key Architecture Components

#### 1. **Dynamic Micro-Agent Template** (`dynamic_agent.py`)
- **One agent implementation** handles all tasks
- **Configurable instructions, tools, and context** for each task
- **Task-driven execution** based on TaskDefinition
- **Automatic dependency resolution** and context injection

#### 2. **Workflow Manager** (`workflow_manager.py`)
- **Defines workflows as sets of tasks** rather than hardcoded agent sequences
- **Analyzes task dependencies** to determine optimal parallel execution
- **Creates dynamic agents on-demand** based on task requirements
- **Orchestrates parallel execution** with automatic dependency resolution

#### 3. **Task Definition System**
```python
TaskDefinition(
    task_id="license_verification",
    name="License & Edition Verification", 
    description="Check Splunk license and edition status",
    instructions="...",  # Focused instructions for this specific task
    required_tools=["run_oneshot_search", "get_current_user"],
    dependencies=[],  # No dependencies - can run in parallel
    context_requirements=[]
)
```

#### 4. **Dynamic Coordinator** (`dynamic_coordinator.py`)
- **Orchestrates dynamic micro-agents** using workflow definitions
- **Executes predefined workflows** (missing data, performance, health check)
- **Creates custom workflows on-the-fly** based on problem analysis
- **Automatically determines optimal parallelization** based on task dependencies

## Architecture Benefits

### 🎯 **Dynamic Scalability**
- **Create as many agents as needed** based on the number of tasks
- **No fixed agent architecture** - completely flexible and efficient
- **Scale up or down** based on workflow complexity

### 🔀 **Task-Driven Parallelization**
- **Any independent task** automatically becomes a parallel micro-agent
- **Automatic dependency analysis** creates optimal execution phases
- **Maximum parallel efficiency** based on task relationships

### 🛠️ **Workflow Flexibility**
- **Built-in workflows** for common scenarios (missing data, performance, health check)
- **Custom workflow creation** on-the-fly for specific use cases
- **Reusable task definitions** across different workflows

### ⚡ **Performance & Efficiency**
- **Parallel execution** reduces overall time

- **Dynamic scaling** creates only needed agents
- **Efficient resource utilization**

### 🧠 **Context Efficiency** (Solves Original Rate Limiting Problem)
- **Each agent gets only relevant context** for its task
- **No massive instruction sets** sent to every LLM call
- **Reduced token usage** and OpenAI rate limiting
- **Better focus and accuracy** per task

## Implementation Details

### Built-in Workflows

#### 1. **Missing Data Troubleshooting Workflow**
```python
Tasks:
├── license_verification (independent)     ┐
├── index_verification (independent)       ├─ Phase 1 (parallel)
├── time_range_verification (independent)  ┘
└── permissions_verification (depends on license) ─ Phase 2

Parallel Efficiency: 75% (4 tasks in 2 phases vs 4 sequential)
```

#### 2. **Performance Analysis Workflow**
```python
Tasks:
├── system_resource_baseline (independent)      ┐
├── search_concurrency_analysis (independent)   ├─ Phase 1 (parallel)
└── indexing_performance_analysis (independent) ┘

Parallel Efficiency: 100% (3 tasks in 1 phase vs 3 sequential)
```

#### 3. **Health Check Workflow**
```python
Tasks:
├── connectivity_check (independent)    ┐
└── basic_data_check (independent)      ┘─ Phase 1 (parallel)

Parallel Efficiency: 100% (2 tasks in 1 phase vs 2 sequential)
```

### Custom Workflow Creation

You can now create workflows dynamically:

```python
# Define custom tasks for any scenario
custom_tasks = [
    TaskDefinition(
        task_id="firewall_connectivity",
        name="Firewall Connectivity Check",
        instructions="Check firewall data ingestion...",
        required_tools=["run_oneshot_search", "list_indexes"],
        dependencies=[],  # Independent
    ),
    TaskDefinition(
        task_id="threat_detection_status", 
        name="Threat Detection Status",
        instructions="Verify threat detection systems...",
        required_tools=["run_oneshot_search"],
        dependencies=[],  # Independent
    ),
    TaskDefinition(
        task_id="network_baseline_analysis",
        name="Network Baseline Analysis", 
        instructions="Analyze network traffic patterns...",
        required_tools=["run_oneshot_search"],
        dependencies=["firewall_connectivity"],  # Depends on firewall check
    )
]

# Create workflow from tasks
workflow = coordinator.create_custom_workflow_from_tasks(
    workflow_id="network_security_analysis",
    workflow_name="Network Security Analysis",
    task_definitions=custom_tasks
)

# Execute with automatic parallelization
result = await coordinator.execute_custom_workflow(workflow, context, problem)
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from src.tools.agents.shared import AgentConfig, SplunkDiagnosticContext, SplunkToolRegistry
from src.tools.agents.dynamic_coordinator import DynamicCoordinator

# Create coordinator
config = AgentConfig(api_key="your-key", model="gpt-4", temperature=0.1)
tool_registry = SplunkToolRegistry()
coordinator = DynamicCoordinator(config, tool_registry)

# Create diagnostic context
context = SplunkDiagnosticContext(
    earliest_time="-2h",
    latest_time="now", 
    indexes=["security", "firewall"],
    sourcetypes=["cisco:asa", "pan:traffic"]
)

# Execute missing data analysis with automatic parallelization
result = await coordinator.execute_missing_data_analysis(
    context, 
    "Security dashboard shows no firewall events"
)
```

### Advanced Custom Workflows
```python
# List available workflows
workflows = coordinator.list_available_workflows()
for workflow in workflows:
    print(f"{workflow['name']}: {workflow['parallel_efficiency']:.1%} efficiency")

# Create custom workflow for specific use case
custom_workflow = coordinator.create_custom_workflow_from_tasks(
    workflow_id="custom_analysis",
    workflow_name="Custom Security Analysis",
    task_definitions=your_custom_tasks
)

# Execute with automatic dependency resolution and parallelization
result = await coordinator.execute_custom_workflow(
    custom_workflow, context, problem_description
)
```

## Performance Comparison

### Before: Static Specific Agents
```
Problems:
❌ Fixed agent files for each task type
❌ Manual coordination between agents  
❌ Difficult to add new task types
❌ No automatic dependency resolution
❌ Still sent large context to each agent
```

### After: Dynamic Task-Driven Agents
```
Benefits:
✅ One dynamic agent template handles all tasks
✅ Automatic parallel execution based on dependencies
✅ Easy to add new tasks and workflows
✅ Automatic dependency resolution and execution planning
✅ Minimal context per agent (only what's needed for that task)
✅ Dynamic scaling - create exactly as many agents as needed
```

### Execution Performance

**Missing Data Workflow Example:**
- **Sequential Execution**: 4 time units (if all tasks ran one after another)
- **Parallel Execution**: 2 time units (with dependency-aware parallelization)
- **Theoretical Speedup**: 2x faster
- **Efficiency Gain**: 50% reduction in execution time

**Context Efficiency:**
- **Before**: Each agent received full troubleshooting instructions (~5000 tokens)
- **After**: Each agent receives only task-specific instructions (~500-1000 tokens)
- **Token Reduction**: 80-90% per agent call
- **Rate Limiting**: Significantly reduced due to smaller requests
