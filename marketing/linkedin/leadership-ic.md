## How MCP for Splunk Turns Runbooks into Reusable AI Value (Leadership & IC)

Leaders want consistent outcomes; ICs want less toil and faster answers. MCP for Splunk by Deslicer connects LLMs to Splunk with the features enterprises expect — without asking teams to rewrite how they work.

- One server, many tenants: Client‑scoped headers let a single MCP endpoint serve multiple Splunk instances (dev/test/prod, teams, regions) — no restarts to switch targets.
- Agentic AI workflows: Convert manual runbooks into chained tasks where each step can call built‑in tools (search, admin, config, etc.) with its own instructions and inputs.
- Example: `missing_data_troubleshooting.json` implements Splunk’s official inputs troubleshooting as a repeatable workflow.

- Embedded Splunk resources: LLMs respond with better context and fewer hallucinations.
- Community‑first FOSS: Free and open source, built by the community for the community — and will remain that way.

Why this matters:
- Productivity: Guided incident triage and repeatable outcomes across teams
- Knowledge transfer: Bottle “hero mode” into shareable automation
- Enterprise readiness: Broad tool surface (search, metadata, health, admin) and multi‑client isolation
