# Documentation Review Report (Updated)

This report inventories every document under `docs/`, maps where each is referenced, flags broken or outdated links, and gives specific actions.

Updated to reflect the current `docs/` tree (26 markdown files).

## Summary

- Total docs found: 26
- High-priority broken links: 18
- Likely orphaned docs (no inbound references): 8
- Duplicate/overlap to consolidate: 1

## High-Priority Fixes

- Root `README.md` links:
  - Update `docs/agents-as-tools-readme.md` → `docs/guides/workflows/agents-as-tools-readme.md`.
  - Remove or replace API links (`docs/api/`) — the `docs/api/` directory no longer exists.
  - Update contributing link: `docs/community/contributing.md` → `docs/contrib/contributing.md` (or to repo root `CONTRIBUTING.md`).
- `docs/README.md` still references many non-existent pages; update or remove:
  - Getting Started: `getting-started/tutorial.md`, `getting-started/troubleshooting.md` (missing)
  - Architecture: `architecture/components.md`, `architecture/extending.md` (missing)
  - API: `reference/resources.md`
  - Reference: `reference/configuration.md` (missing)
  - Community: `community/tool-development.md` (use `contrib/tool_development.md`), `community/...` (community dir removed; use `contrib/...`)
  - Guides: `guides/security.md`, `guides/monitoring.md`, `guides/deployment/kubernetes.md`, `guides/deployment/cloud.md` (missing)
- Fix `docs/getting-started/installation.md` bottom references:
  - `../DOCKER.md` → `../guides/deployment/DOCKER.md`
  - `../TESTING.md` → `../guides/TESTING.md` (and optionally link `../tests.md` for quick start)
  - `../ARCHITECTURE.md` → `../architecture/` (or `../architecture/README.md`)
  - `../contrib/README.md` → `../contrib/contributing.md` (or repo root `CONTRIBUTING.md`)
- Workflows docs:
  - `docs/guides/workflows/README.md` links `./hands-on-lab.md` → should be `../../labs/hands-on-lab.md`.
  - `docs/labs/hands-on-lab.md` references `../guides/template-replacement-guide.md` and `../guides/agent-tracing-guide.md`; actual paths are under `docs/guides/workflows/` now.
  - `docs/guides/workflows/workflows-overview.md` references `community/contributing.md`; update to `../../contrib/contributing.md`.
- Integration guide: `docs/guides/integration/README.md` links `../security.md` (missing). Either create `docs/guides/security.md` or retarget to a relevant existing doc.
- Deployment overview: `docs/guides/deployment/README.md` links `kubernetes.md`, `cloud.md`, `../security.md`, `../monitoring.md` (missing). Create placeholders or remove rows.
- Consider removing or consolidating `docs/reference/tools.md` (duplicated by `docs/api/tools.md` in the old structure; API directory removed).
- Examples: Update `examples/client_config_demo.py` to point to `docs/guides/configuration/client_configuration.md`.

## Additional Cross-Repo Broken References

- `examples/client_config_demo.py` points to `docs/client_configuration.md` (missing). Update to `docs/guides/configuration/client_configuration.md`.

---

## Proposed Cleanup Plan

1) Update top-level navigation and fix broken links:
- Root `README.md` references (agents, API, contributing) and `docs/README.md` tables/links.

2) Create missing stubs or remove broken links in:
- `docs/README.md`, `docs/architecture/README.md`, `docs/guides/deployment/README.md`, `docs/guides/integration/README.md`, `docs/getting-started/installation.md`, `docs/guides/workflows/README.md`.

3) Add links for orphaned but useful guides:
- `docs/guides/workflows/openai-agent-integration.md`
- `docs/guides/workflows/handoff-based-troubleshooting.md`
- `docs/guides/workflows/workflow_runner_guide.md`
- `docs/guides/prompt-engineering.md` (if still intended; otherwise remove)
- `docs/labs/hands-on-lab.md`

4) Consolidate duplicates:
- Remove or replace `docs/reference/tools.md` with a pointer to current tooling docs.

5) Correct external code references:
- Update `examples/client_config_demo.py` link path.

6) Optional: add or adjust references to match content:
- Add `docs/guides/security.md`, `docs/guides/monitoring.md`, `docs/guides/deployment/{kubernetes,cloud}.md` or remove links that point to them.
- If an API reference is desired, restore `docs/api/` or remove those entries.
