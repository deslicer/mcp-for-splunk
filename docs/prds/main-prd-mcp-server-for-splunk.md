# Product Requirements Document: Splunk MCP Server (Full Scope)

## 1. Introduction
The Splunk MCP Server aims to be a robust, open-source intermediary that seamlessly and comprehensively connects Large Language Models (LLMs), AI agents, and other developer tools with Splunk instances (Enterprise/Cloud). Its vision is to empower AI-driven interaction with Splunk data and functionalities, fostering a vibrant community and enabling innovative use cases in AIOps, SecOps, Business Analytics, and general data exploration.

## 2. Long-Term Goals
* Provide a comprehensive suite of MCP tools covering a wide range of Splunk functionalities.
* Become a standard, go-to solution for AI/LLM integration with Splunk.
* Foster an active open-source community for tool development, feature enhancements, and support.
* Ensure robust security, scalability, and performance for various deployment scenarios.
* Enable sophisticated conversational interactions with Splunk data through LLMs.
* Support advanced Splunk capabilities and administrative tasks via MCP tools.

## 3. Target Users & Use Cases
* **Developers building AI Agents/LLM-powered applications:** Requiring Splunk data or actions.
* **Data Analysts/Scientists:** Using LLMs to explore Splunk data conversationally.
* **DevOps/SRE Teams:** Automating Splunk queries and actions for AIOps.
* **Security Analysts:** Leveraging LLMs for threat hunting and incident response in Splunk.
* **Users of MCP-enabled IDEs (e.g., Cursor):** Interacting with Splunk directly from their development environment.

## 4. Potential Features (Beyond MVP)

**4.1. Expanded Splunk Data Interaction Tools:**
* Real-time search support.
* Access to and management of search jobs (create, status, results, cancel).
* Tools for working with Splunk data models and acceleration.
* Support for summary indexing and reporting.
* Tools for interacting with Splunk lookups (reading, possibly updating).
* Tools for managing and querying the KV Store.

**4.2. Splunk Management & Configuration Tools:**
* Managing Splunk knowledge objects (e.g., saved searches, alerts, event types, tags, macros).
* Tools for interacting with Splunk inputs and data onboarding (status, basic management).
* User and role management (read-only introspection).
* Index management (listing properties, metrics).
* Distributed search head and indexer cluster introspection.

**4.3. Advanced Server Features:**
* **Authentication/Authorization:** Optional layer for the MCP server itself (e.g., API keys for clients).
* **Tool Usage Analytics/Logging:** Detailed logging of tool calls for monitoring and auditing.
* **Dynamic Tool Registration:** Mechanisms for users to add custom tools more easily.
* **Multi-Splunk Instance Support:** Ability for a single MCP server to connect to and manage tools for multiple Splunk environments (with appropriate configuration).
* **Enhanced Error Handling & Reporting:** More detailed error messages and context back to the LLM.
* **Caching Layer:** For frequently requested, non-volatile data from Splunk (e.g., list of indexes, certain lookup files).

**4.4. Community & Extensibility:**
* Clear guidelines and framework for community tool contributions.
* Standardized testing framework for new tools.
* Extensive documentation with examples for various LLMs and agent frameworks.
* Potential for a plugin architecture.

## 5. Integration Points
* Verified compatibility with popular LLM frameworks (e.g., LangChain, LlamaIndex).
* Tested with various AI Agent development kits (e.g., Google ADK, Autogen).
* Examples for connecting from different programming languages to the MCP server.

## 6. Key Non-Functional Requirements
* **Security:** Secure handling of Splunk credentials, protection against common web vulnerabilities, guidance on secure deployment.
* **Performance:** Efficient handling of requests, especially for data-intensive search operations. Minimize latency.
* **Scalability:** Ability to handle a reasonable number of concurrent requests.
* **Reliability:** Robust error handling and stable operation.
* **Usability:** Easy to deploy, configure, and use for developers. Clear API and tool definitions.
* **Maintainability:** Well-structured, commented, and tested codebase.

## 7. Community and Contribution Strategy
* Establish clear contribution guidelines, code of conduct, and review processes.
* Actively engage with the community on GitHub (issues, discussions).
* Provide good "first issues" for new contributors.
* Showcase community contributions.

## 8. Potential Roadmap (Post-MVP)
* **Phase 1 (MVP+):** Add more search-related tools (e.g., job management), basic KV store read. Refine error handling.
* **Phase 2 (Knowledge Object Interaction):** Tools for listing/describing saved searches, alerts, macros.
* **Phase 3 (Advanced Features):** Real-time search, explore advanced config management.
* **Ongoing:** Community contributions, documentation improvements, security hardening.
